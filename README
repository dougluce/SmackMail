The goal of this project is to allow me to migrate from Pine to
Emacs.  What I want includes:

* IMAP integration
  - Be able to connect to SSLized IMAP servers
  - Be able to save to IMAP folders
  - Especially the sent-mail folder
  - Be able to list folders that I've got up.
* Support for single-window operation
  - When I'm looking at email, I'm looking at email.  When I go into
    one, I'm reading just that email.  When I edit, there's nothing on
    my screen except for the email I'm editing.
* Attachment management
  - Be able to bulk save attachments
* Single-key shortcuts for nearly everything
* MIME support
  - Show what's possible to show (i.e. support for graphics on
     displays that support it)
  - Have easy-to-specify commands for parsing everything else
* Selection of emails
  - By search term
  - Group actions: delete, save, export, flag, pipe.
  - Have a selection ring
  - Narrow on selected
